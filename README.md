# MiniProject1_ShiyueZhou
[![CI-Python Application Test with Github Actions](https://github.com/nogibjj/MiniProject1_ShiyueZhou/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/MiniProject1_ShiyueZhou/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Based on the requirement of miniproject in week2, this will work on the following file/folder to develop the Python Template Sample.  

# requirements.txt<br>
 -->related to packages and version in this project: allows you to specify the exact packages (and versions) to be installed, ensuring consistency across different environments  

# Makefile<br>
 -->For machine reading and executing by running `make all`.  
 -->This sequentially runs `make install`, `make format`, `make lint`, and `make test`.  
    install: Installs the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.  
    format: Formats the code to ensure it follows proper code style (using black).  
    lint:  Runs a linter tool (pylint) to analyze the source code for programming errors, bugs, stylistic issues, and coding standard violations. Ensures code follows best practices and is free of common mistakes before being committed or deployed.practices and is free of common mistakes before it is committed or deployed.  
    test: Uses pytest to run the test files, ensuring the code works as expected.  
    all: Runs all the above tasks sequentially (install, format, lint, test).  

# Dev Container<br>
    The ".devcontainer" folder contains two parts:  
    devcontainer.json: This is the main configuration file that defines the development containerâ€™s setup, specifying the tools, settings, and extensions for the environment.  
    Dockerfile: Defines a custom Docker image used to create the container. It specifies the base image and any additional dependencies or system configurations required for the development environment.  


# Github Actions<br>
    The directory .github/workflows is where you define your workflows for GitHub Actions.
    1. name: CI Pipeline  
        This gives the workflow a name, which will appear in the GitHub Actions tab of your repository.
    2. on:  
        push: This triggers the workflow when code is pushed to the main branch.  
        pull_request: This triggers the workflow when a pull request is opened or updated for the main branch.  
    3. jobs:
        build:  
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
            //This specifies the environment (or runner) where the job will run. GitHub provides hosted runners, and in this case, it uses the latest version of Ubuntu.  
            steps:  
            //Each job contains a series of steps. Steps are the individual tasks performed in sequence.
